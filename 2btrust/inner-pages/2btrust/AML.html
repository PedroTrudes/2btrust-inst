                                        It is the policy of the firm to prohibit and actively prevent money 
                                        laundering and any activity that facilitates money laundering or the 
                                        funding of terrorist or criminal activities by complying with all applicable 
                                        requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and its implementing regulations.

                                        Money laundering is generally defined as engaging in acts designed to conceal or 
                                        disguise the true origins of criminally derived proceeds so that the proceeds 
                                        appear to have derived from legitimate origins or constitute legitimate assets. 
                                        Generally, money laundering occurs in three stages. Cash first enters the financial 
                                        system at the "placement" stage, where the cash generated from criminal activities is 
                                        converted into monetary instruments, such as money orders or traveler's checks, or 
                                        deposited into accounts at financial institutions. At the "layering" stage, the funds 
                                        are transferred or moved into other accounts or other financial institutions to further 
                                        separate the money from its criminal origin. At the "integration" stage, the funds are 
                                        reintroduced into the economy and used to purchase legitimate assets or to fund other 
                                        criminal activities or legitimate businesses.  
                                        
                                        Although cash is rarely deposited into securities accounts, the securities industry 
                                        is unique in that it can be used to launder funds obtained elsewhere, and to generate 
                                        illicit funds within the industry itself through fraudulent activities. Examples of 
                                        types of fraudulent activities include insider trading, market manipulation, ponzi 
                                        schemes, cybercrime and other investment-related fraudulent activity.
                                        
                                        Terrorist financing may not involve the proceeds of criminal conduct, but rather an 
                                        attempt to conceal either the origin of the funds or their intended use, which could 
                                        be for criminal purposes. Legitimate sources of funds are a key difference between 
                                        terrorist financiers and traditional criminal organizations. In addition to charitable 
                                        donations, legitimate sources include foreign government sponsors, business ownership 
                                        and personal employment. Although the motivation differs between traditional money 
                                        launderers and terrorist financiers, the actual methods used to fund terrorist 
                                        operations can be the same as or similar to methods used by other criminals to launder 
                                        funds. Funding for terrorist attacks does not always require large sums of money and 
                                        the associated transactions may not be complex.
                                        
                                        Our AML policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to ensure compliance 
                                        with all applicable BSA regulations and FINRA rules and will be reviewed and updated 
                                        on a regular basis to ensure appropriate policies, procedures and internal controls 
                                        are in place to account for both changes in regulations and changes in our business.

                                    We will respond to a Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) request concerning 
                                    accounts and transactions (a 314(a) Request) by immediately searching our records to

                                    transaction with, each individual, entity or organization named in the 314(a) Request as 
                                    outlined in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) located on FinCEN’s secure website. We 
                                    understand that we have 14 days (unless otherwise specified by FinCEN) from the transmission 
                                    date of the request to respond to a 314(a) Request. Unless otherwise stated in the 314(a) 
                                    Request or specified by FinCEN, we are required to search those documents outlined in FinCEN’s 
                                    FAQ. If we find a match, Aline Gialluisi Seripieri de Abreu will report it to FinCEN via 
                                    FinCEN’s Web-based 314(a) Secure Information Sharing System within 14 days or within the time 
                                    requested by FinCEN in the request. If the search parameters differ from those mentioned above 
                                    (for example, if FinCEN limits the search to a geographic location), Aline Gialluisi Seripieri 
                                    de Abreu will structure our search accordingly.

                                    If Aline Gialluisi Seripieri de Abreu searches our records and does not find a matching

                                    and confidentiality of requests from FinCEN similar to those procedures established to satisfy

                                        a customer does not in itself require that we file a Suspicious

                                        If we file a SAR after receiving a grand jury subpoena, the SAR will

                                        Aline Gialluisi Seripieri de Abreu will ensure that the firm files

                                        notices thereafter. We will use the notice form found at FinCEN’s 
                                        website. Before we share information with another financial 
                                        institution, we will take reasonable steps to verify that the other 
                                        financial institution has submitted the requisite notice to FinCEN, 
                                        either by obtaining confirmation from the financial institution or by 
                                        consulting a list of such financial institutions that FinCEN will make 
                                        available. We understand that this requirement applies even to financial
                                        institutions with which we are affiliated, and that we will obtain the 
                                        requisite notices from affiliates and follow all required procedures. 

                                        We will employ strict procedures both to ensure that only relevant information

                                    de Abreu will check to ensure that a customer does not appear on the SDN list 
                                    or is not engaging in transactions that are prohibited by the economic sanctions 
                                    and embargoes administered and enforced by OFAC.
                                    If we determine that a customer is on the SDN list or is engaging in transactions 
                                    that are prohibited by the economic sanctions and embargoes administered and 
                                    enforced by OFAC, we will reject the transaction and/or block the customer's 
                                    assets and file a blocked assets and/or rejected transaction form with OFAC 
                                    within 10 days. We will also call the OFAC Hotline at (800) 540-6322 immediately.
                                    Our review will include customer accounts, transactions involving customers 
                                    (including activity that passes through the firm such as wires) and the review

                                    belief that we know the true identity of the customer. 

                                    We will verify customer identity through documentary means, non-documentary means or 
                                    both. We will use documents to verify customer identity when appropriate documents 
                                    are available. In light of the increased instances of identity fraud, we will 
                                    supplement the use of documentary evidence by using the non-documentary means described 
                                    below whenever necessary. We may also use non-documentary means, if we are still uncertain 
                                    about whether we know the true identity of the customer. In verifying the information, 
                                    we will consider whether the identifying information that we receive, such as the customer’s 
                                    name, street address, zip code, telephone number (if provided), date of birth and Social 
                                    Security number, allow us to determine that we have a reasonable belief that we know the

                                    (1) the customer is unable to present an unexpired government-issued 
                                    identification document with a photograph or other similar safeguard; <br>
                                    (2) the firm is unfamiliar with the documents the customer presents for

                                    (3) the customer and firm do not have face-to-face contact; and <br>
                                    (4) there are other circumstances that increase the risk that the firm will

                                    means.  <br><br>
                                                                                                
                                    We will verify the information within a reasonable time before or after the account 
                                    is opened. Depending on the nature of the account and requested transactions,
                                     we may refuse to complete a transaction before we have verified the information, 
                                     or in some instances when we need more time, we may, pending verification, restrict

                                    We recognize that the risk that we may not know the customer’s true identity may be 
                                    heightened for certain types of accounts, such as an account opened in the name of a

                                    a jurisdiction that has been designated by the U.S. as a primary money laundering 
                                    jurisdiction, a terrorist concern, or has been designated as a non-cooperative country 
                                    or territory. We will identify customers that pose a heightened risk of not being 
                                    properly identified. We will also take the following additional measures that may be 
                                    used to obtain information about the identity of the individuals associated with the 
                                    customer when standard documentary methods prove to be insufficient.

                                     immediate attention by the SEC. See Section 11 for contact numbers. We also understand that, even if we

                                     management, with a clear reminder of the need to maintain the confidentiality of the SAR.  <br> <br>

                                     We will report suspicious transactions by completing a SAR, and we will collect and maintain supporting 
                                     documentation as required by the BSA regulations. We will file a SAR-SF no later than 30 calendar days 
                                     after the date of the initial detection of the facts that constitute a basis for filing a SAR. If no suspect 
                                     is identified on the date of initial detection, we may delay filing the SAR for an additional 30 calendar days 
                                     pending identification of a suspect, but in no case will the reporting be delayed more than 60 calendar
                                      days after the date of initial detection. The phrase “initial detection” does not mean the moment a 
                                      transaction is highlighted for review. The 30-day (or 60-day) period begins when an appropriate review is 
                                      conducted and a determination is made that the transaction under review is “suspicious” within the meaning 
                                      of the SAR requirements. A review must be initiated promptly upon identification of unusual activity that 
                                      warrants investigation.<br><br>

                                      We will retain copies of any SAR filed and the original or business record equivalent of any supporting

                                    We will develop ongoing employee training under the leadership of the AML Compliance Person and senior management. 
                                    Our training will occur on at least an annual basis. It will be based on our firm’s size, its customer base, and its 
                                    resources and be updated as necessary to reflect any new developments in the law.<br><br>

                                    Our training will include, at a minimum: (1) how to identify red flags and signs of money laundering that arise 
                                    during the course of the employees’ duties; (2) what to do once the risk is identified (including how, 
                                    when and to whom to escalate unusual customer activity or other red flags for analysis and, where 
                                    appropriate, the filing of SARs); (3) what employees' roles are in the firm's compliance efforts and how to 
                                    perform them; (4) the firm's record retention policy; and (5) the disciplinary consequences (including civil 
                                    and criminal penalties) for non-compliance with the BSA. <br><br>

                                    We will develop training in our firm, or contract for it. Delivery of the training may include educational pamphlets, 
                                    videos, intranet systems, in-person lectures and explanatory memos. We will maintain records to show the 
                                    persons trained, the dates of training and the subject matter of their training. <br><br>

                                    We will review our operations to see if certain employees, such as those in compliance, margin and corporate security, 
                                    require specialized additional training. Our written procedures will be updated to reflect any such changes.
